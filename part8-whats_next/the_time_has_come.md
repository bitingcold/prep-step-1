Hey folks,

Great job completing the curriculum for JumpStart Step 1. The next step is to take
the first assessment.

As a reminder, the practice assessments will be forty-five minutes long, and you'll have
to answer three coding questions. This is different than the actual JumpStart Assessment
which is an hour long with 4 coding questions.

We've given you six practice assessments to prepare! Head over to your Repl.it classroom and 
give them a try!

Good luck, future devs!
